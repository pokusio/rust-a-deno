# About Triage bootstrap

I searched github for triage bots like that : https://github.com/search?q=triage+bot

And I found :

* A very interesting even if not maintained Triage Bot designed for DevSecops :
  * It fetches [Hacker One vulnerabilities reports](https://www.hackerone.com/) to be informed of new discovered vulnerabilities and launch checks to discover is taht vulnerability is in any Git repo in a Github Org
  * https://github.com/salesforce/AutoTriageBot
  * it's old, has not been maintained for long
* https://github.com/BirthdayResearch/oss-governance-bot
* https://github.com/slackapi/template-triage-bot
* https://github.com/tunnckoCore/triage-new-issues


Just a first fact i notice :

there are not that many Bots designed to help people in their CICD / social project management

It's social project management acutally thee, like a project management pattern where a third party is there actively taking part into the project management

at least there are not a lot of bots designed to help people manage issues : labelling, following up tasks completion, keeping people informed on chaptops :

There could be a bot taht says in github issue comments to issue author:
